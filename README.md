This script can be run to simulate the available tiles in the standard version of Scrabble.  Defaulting to 4 players and 7 tiles per tile rack. The script will run and prompt for letters to be used on the board, and refresh the tile rack with available tiles from the bag.

The script supports skipping turns, reshuffling entire rack, and accurately simulate the probability of drawing tiles (12 times more likely to draw an E as a Q at the start of the game.

## Coming soon!

The game needs to support writing state to the outside world and providing a view of the tile rack from an AWS site - viewing the tile rack on phone!

It would also be nice to have the board simulated accurately with scoring, valid words applied - this is a much (much!) larger project.
